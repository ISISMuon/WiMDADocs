WiMDA Main Menu
===============

WiMDA's main menu is the window which is used to load data in, and to open up the various other
windows for data analysis. It is the first window which opens when you run WiMDA.

Run Information
---------------

The main menu shows the following information about the run:

.. list-table::
    :width: 100%
    :widths: 20 80
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Field
      - Description
    * - Run Number
      - The run number of the data file currently loaded. This will be zero if you are at a facility
        looking at a run in process.
    * - Title
      - Title of the run, set by the user when doing the experiment (usually the sample name).
    * - Temperature
      - The temperature the run was taken at. By default, this is the temperature in the run label, which
        may be different from the temperature the sample was actually at when the data were taken (see the
        hint below).
    * - Field
      - The magnetic field applied on the sample when the run was taken. Like temperature, by default this
        is the field written in the run labels, which may be slightly different from the field at the sample
        (see hint below).
    * - Comment
      - The user-defined comment in the data file, usually containing extra information about the run.
    * - Started/Stopped
      - The data and time the data collection started and stopped.
    * - Histograms
      - The number of histograms measuring the positron events -- essentially the number of detectors. If the
        instrument contains more than 32 detectors (e.g EMU), multiple detectors are put into one histogram.
        For each histogram, the data is discretised into :math:`n` bins of :math:`t` seconds each, so
        the longest time the data goes out to is :math:`nt`.
    * - Events
      - The number of muon decay events measured across all detectors, in MEv (Millions of Events). For
        pulsed facilities, it also shows how many frames ('fr', which is the number of pulses of muons
        incident on the sample), and the number of events per frame (Ev/fr), which corresponds to the number of
        decaying muons picked up by the detectors per pulse. If the number of events per frame is particularly
        large, you should consider applying a deadtime correction.
    * - Directory
      - The directory where WiMDA is loading the data files from.

.. hint:: To make it so that the temperature or field listed in the WiMDA main menu is the average temperature
          from the temperature or field logs (something one often wants to do), go to the 'Fit Table' window,
          click 'Options' and then 'T [or B] from ave in TLOG', and load the data again..

Run Navigation
--------------

The white text box below the run information by default shows the current run number. This can be
increased or decreased using the 'STEP >>' and '<< STEP' buttons respectively, or you can type in a
different run number manually. Clicking 'LOAD' loads the run number in the white text box, and
the '<< LOAD' and 'LOAD >>' buttons load the next and previous runs respectively.

In experiments where multiple runs are taken with the same conditions, these can be combined with the
'COADD' buttons, which produces a weighted average of the multiple runs, weighted by the number of
events.

Menus

File Menu
~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
    :width: 100%
    :widths: 20 80
    :header-rows: 0

    * - Open
      - Opens desired file for WiMDA analysis. When the file is opened WiMDA saves the file
        location and filename format details as defaults in the set-up file.
    * - Save/ Save as
      - Creates an ASCII file containing the results produced by WiMDA. E.g. if a plot of
        asymmetry versus time was produced a file containing the times and corresponding
        values of asymmetry would be created. If the plot was fitted then the fit values can also
        be saved.
    * - Load fit libraries
      - Specifies the directory where the libraries of fit functions are to be loaded from and loads them.
    * - Printer set-up
      - Allows printer options to be chosen e.g. which printer to use or whether to print portrait
        or landscape documents
    * - Co-sub mode
      - This switches the co-add function to co-subtract. Allows one run to be subtracted from
        another. This is usually used if e.g. an experiment is left to run until 10 million events
        are recorded and then stopped. Then the same experiment is left running until 20 million results
        are recorded. The 10 million event run could be subtracted from the 20 million event run
        to obtain the results of the experiment between 10 and 20 million events.
    * - Setup
      - Open the WiMDA setup window -- see the 'Setting up WiMDA' section :ref:`here <wimda-setup>`.
    * - Generate test data
      - Generates test data for the function in the analysis window (see the :ref:`Analyse window section <analyse>`).
    * - Generate histogram report
      - Generates a table of the number of decay events in each histogram for each run. This file will be
        saved in the analysis directory.
    * - Exit
      - Exits the program

Logbook
~~~~~~~

Opens up a window to create a logbook, showing a summary of all the runs taken.

Group
~~~~~

Opens the Grouping window, which allows one to group the data appropriately before fitting,
apply background and deadtime corrections, and estimate alpha.

Plot
~~~~

    * **Data** Open up the window showing a plot of the data.
    * **Parameters** Select the plot parameters (whether to plot counts or asymmetry, axis limits, ticks, etc).
    * **GLE** Open a GLE editor, for editing the model plot output.
    * **Hard Copy** Print the plot in the plot window.

Analyse
~~~~~~~

Opens the analysis window, where one can define a fit function for the data and use this to fit it.

Model
~~~~~

Use the output of the fits of the data (in the Fit Table window) to fit a function to the
fitted parameters.

MaxEnt
~~~~~~

Opens the Maximum Entropy analysis window, which creates the frequency spectrum with the minimum
structure from the measured data.

Fourier
~~~~~~~

Opens the Fourier window, which allows one to define parameters for the fourier transform
if one is plotting the frequency spectrum of the data.
