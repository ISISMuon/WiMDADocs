Logbook

A logbook containing the run number, type of sample, temperature, magnetic field, date,
time and number of events recorded in a particular set of experiments can be created using
the logbook window. This window looks like this:

To load the run information, enter the first and last run numbers you are interested
in into the 'From Run' and 'To Run' boxes. To also list out the temperature measured
by the sensors on the instrument, tick the 'Use T Log' checkbox. NeXus files can contain
many different field and temperature logs from multiple sensors, and the particular log
you are interested in can be specified by the 'Nexus T/B log' text boxes. The average
value of other logs stored in the nexus files can also be listed out for each run by
specifying 'AuxLog1/2'.

.. hint::
    To read all the run information in the Nexus files, use the free utility JournalViewer,
    which can be downloaded from `here <https://www.projectaten.com/jv>`_.

Clicking 'Import Headers' loads all the run headers from the data files in the range
specified into the window. Once these are loaded, you can annotate the logbook by
writing comments into the text area, and the logbook can be saved using the 'Save' button.
