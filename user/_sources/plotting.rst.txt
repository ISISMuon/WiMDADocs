Plot Window
===========

To launch the main plot window, go to the main menu and click 'Plot' then 'Data'. A window
will come up which looks like the following:

    :width: 500
    :alt: WiMDA's plot window
    :align: center

Saving the plot
---------------

This plot can be saved by clicking the 'Save' button at the top, which launches a menu allowing
one to save the data in this plot, save the data *and* the fit (in one file), or just the fit.
If you have a lot of successive runs you wish to save, click 'Batch save data' and type in the first
and last run you want to save. By default, data will be saved in the analysis directory, and will
be saved in a plain text format suitable for most other plotting and fitting programs. If you don't
want to save all the data in the plot, the x-range can be set with the relevant option in the menu.

Cursor stuff?

Plot Parameters
===============

The plot can be changed with the plot parameters window, which can be launched from the WiMDA
main menu by clicking 'Plot' and then 'Parameters'. The window looks like the following:

.. note:: After making changes in this window, you may need to click on the plot window for
        it to update

Plot data group
---------------

    * **All groups** Plot each group as a separate graph
    * **F-B group** Plot the forward and backwards group (use this for F/B asymmetry)
    * **Selected group** Plot only the group specified in the box below this radio button

Plot mode
---------

**When plotting single groups, you have the following options:**
    * **Raw plot** Plot the raw number of counts as a function of time
    * **Log plot** As raw plot, but with a logarithmic (base 10) scale
    * **Asym plot** Plot the raw counts multiplied by :math:`\exp(t/\tau_\mu)`.
    * **Freq plot** Plot the frequency spectrum (use the Fourier window to change the FFT parameters)

**When plotting in F-B mode, you have the following additional options:**
    * **F-B asym** Plot the forwards-backwards asymmetry
    * **F-B overlay** Plot the forwards and backwards counts on the same graph, with the exponential
      decay removed by multiplying the data by :math:`\exp(t/\tau_\mu)`
    * **F-B freq** Plot the fourier spectrum of the F-B asymmetry (use the Fourier window to change the FFT parameters)

Plot style
----------

This area lets you change the style of the points, and allows you to not show the error bars. The 'Overlay' option
keeps the current data on the graph when using the 'LOAD' buttons on the main menu to change between runs.

.. note:: These options only change how the data is displayed -- when analysing the data, only the current run will be
    fitted.

Muon Type
---------

This lets you change the decay lifetime of the muon, which is useful for :math:`\mu^-` SR experiments. To do this,
select 'Minus' and then change the lifetime in the box next to :math:`\tau`.

Rotating Reference Frame (RRF)
------------------------------

The rotating reference frame transformation is useful for analysing high frequency signals. This feature allows one to
transform the data from the lab frame into a frame which rotates at a frequency close to (but not quite) the muon
precession frequency, which makes high-frequency relaxation processes easier to observe.

Specifically, the RRF transformation with a reference frame frequency of :math:`\omega_{\rm RRF}` and phase of
:math:`\phi` transforms the asymmetry data in the lab frame (:math:`A_{\rm lab}`) to the rotating frame by
:math:`A_{\rm RRF}(t)=A_{\rm lab}\cos(\omega_{\rm RRF}t+\phi)`. :math:`\omega_{\rm RRF}` and :math:`\phi` are set by
top-right and bottom-left boxes of the Rotating Reference Frame panel respectively, and the box at the bottom-right
(with the label 'µs smooth') smooths out the points by averaging over the specified time period.

.. note:: In WiMDA, this transformation is only applied visually -- it is not possible to fit RRF data.

Axes
----

This section controls the axes limits and ticks on the plot. Ticking the 'Autoscale' options adjusts the axes so that
all of the data and errors are visible on the plot. The units of the x-axis can be changed using the radio buttons on
the right-hand side of the panel.

.. hint:: Ticking 'Autoscale X+Y' often results in asymmetry plots having too large a Y-axis range due to the large
    errors on the data at late times. A good starting point is to set the X-axis maximum to 8 µs, and autoscaling Y.

.. note::
    Changing the axis limits does not affect the range of data which will be fitted -- it is only possible to
    change this in the Analyse window.
