==================
Installing WiMDA
==================

A fully tested, stable version of WiMDA is available in 32-bit, and additionally a 
64-bit version is available for beta testing. We recommend using the 32-bit 
version until the 64-bit version has been fully tested.

Prerequisites 
=============

WiMDA requires the following (free) software packages to run successfully:

        * **Ghostscript** - this is software which GLE needs to be able to plot successfully. 
          It can be downloaded from `<https://www.ghostscript.com/>`_ (click 'Download' then
          'Ghostscript', then select either the 32- or 64-bit version).
        * **GLE** - this is a plotting tool which is used by WiMDA to produce publication-quality 
          figures. It can be downloaded from `<https://glx.sourceforge.io/>`_ (this website also
          contains a good user guide and examples detailing how to use the program). Make sure
          the architecture matches that of the ghostscript library you have installed on your
          system: a 64-bit version of GLE will not work with a 32-bit version of Ghostscript.

.. Hint:: A full GLE installation also requires a LATEX distribution to be
          installed on your system, but this is *not* required for WiMDA.

.. _wininstall:

Installation
============

Installing on Windows Computers
-------------------------------

To install WiMDA on Windows, after installing the prerequisites above
first download either the
`32-bit package <http://shadow.nd.rl.ac.uk/wimda/download/currentwimda/WiMDA-32bit.zip>`_ or
the `(beta) 64-bit package <http://shadow.nd.rl.ac.uk/wimda/download/currentwimda/WiMDA-64bit.zip>`_.
Installing WiMDA is a matter of simply decompressing these zip
archives on your system in the location you wish to install WiMDA. The
program can be run by running wimda.exe.

Installing on Mac/Linux Computers
---------------------------------

Although WiMDA cannot run on Mac/Linux systems natively, it is able to
work using `Wine <https://www.winehq.org/>`_, which is an emulation framework which allows windows
programs to run under unix-based systems. The easiest way to install
Wine is using a package manager, for example on MacOS one could use
`HomeBrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ and run (in Terminal)::

    brew install wine-stable

On Ubuntu-like systems Wine can be installed using apt::

    sudo apt-get install wine-stable

Once Wine is installed, follow the Windows instructions
:ref:`above <wininstall>`. To
run wine.exe, you may need to go to terminal and run::

    wine /path/to/wine.exe

.. _wimda-setup:
Setting up WiMDA
================

When you run wimda.exe for the first time, you will be greeted with a
dialog prompting you to set WiMDA up. The setup dialog looks like the
following:

.. image:: screenshots/wimda_setup.PNG
    :width: 400
    :alt: The WiMDA setup window
    :align: center

The fields are as follows:

.. list-table:: Setup window fields
    :width: 100%
    :widths: 25 75
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Field
      - Description
    * - Raw data directory
      - Location of the raw muon data to be analysed.
    * - Analysis directory
      - Location where the analysis files should be written to
        (e.g. fit logs, fit tables, etc).
    * - Fit library directory
      - Location where the user-created fit libraries should be
        loaded from.
    * - Temporary directory
      - Location where the temporary files are stored.
    * - GLE command
      - The location of the gle executable (see below).
    * - GLE version
      - The version of GLE you have installed on your system
        (most likely 4.x).
    * - Output format
      - The output format of the plots produced by the model fitting.
    * - Decompress command
      - The command used to decompress compressed data files.
    * - Compressed file extension
      - The extension of compressed files: WiMDA will automatically
        decompress any files using the decompress command which have this
        file extension.
    * - Extension separator character
      - The character your system uses to separate filenames from their
        extension. You are *very* unlikely to need to change this!

Most of these settings can be kept the way they are, apart from the
GLE command: this should be replaced with the location GLE is installed
on your system. This is usually::

    C:\Program Files (x86)\GLE\bin\gle.exe

for the 32-bit version of GLE and ::

    C:\Program Files\GLE\bin\gle.exe

for the 64-bit.
